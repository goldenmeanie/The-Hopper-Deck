				<h3>The story so far.</h3>
			<p>
				The Hopper Deck originated as a brainstorm during a post-workout shower. A deck of cards would be an excellent and efficient way to carry a set of &ldquo;random&rdquo; workouts on the road, away from the Internet or your local gym. Making it a functioning poker deck meant that it wouldn&rsquo;t be dead weight and therefore more likely to actually go on a trip. The trick would be getting the right set of workouts that would provide balance and respect the potentially austere conditions that the deck would be used in. Fortunately Alex&rsquo;s sister Kelly and her husband John run an affiliate! Enter CrossFit Agoge and the Hopper Deck was born.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the next few months the emails flew and webcams burned as design and content were hashed, rehashed and then hashed one more time. We settled on a visual approach, WODs were collated and assigned to cards, fabricators evaluated and selected. Then Alex painstakingly generated the art for each card. Once we had a coherent body of work we crossed our fingers and went to the Glassmans to secure their blessing. After doing the hundred or so other little things that go into starting a business, we launched the The Hopper Deck at the 2008 CrossFit Games in Aromas, CA.
			</p>
			<p>
				And here we are.
			</p>
			<p>
				The response has been gratifying and we really appreciate the enthusiasm and support that the community has shown us. Especially through the rough first week or so of working the kinks out of our shipping situation. We are proud of the product that we offer here and endeavor to provide customer service to match.
